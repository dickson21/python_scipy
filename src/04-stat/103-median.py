"""
{(n + 1) รท 2}th value, where n is the number of values in a set of data. 
In order to calculate the median, the data must first be ranked (sorted in ascending order). 
The median is the number in the middle. 
Median = the middle value of a set of ordered data

e.g 
[1,2,3] median = 2
[1,2,2,3,3,4,5] median = 3
